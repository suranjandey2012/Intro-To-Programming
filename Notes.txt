-g3 allows to debug macros and hash define constants.

-Wall: It means warning all.

gcc -g3 -Wall pob1.c  -> Compling step

gdb ./a.out  -Run the a.out file

(gdb) run 5 input.txt  -> To provide command line args no need to use 

./a.out arg1 arg2


we can use short forms like 

(gdb) r arg1 arg2

(gdb) h

(gdb) q

(gdb) run < input.txt -> (a.out) is accepting the input from file.

(gdb) break main -> gdb should stop before executing the main function.

(gdb) l -> list the error.

(gdb) p stands for print

(gdb) b main -> set a break point at main

(gdb) n -> next break point

(gdb) i b -> information about the break points

(gdb) n -> To continue to next lines

(gdb) d -> deletes all break points

(gdb) d number -> deletes a particular break point.

(gdb) dis number -> Disable a break point

(gdb) en number -> Enable the number breakpoint

(gdb) breakpoint checks the prev lines.

(gdb) s -> Step into that function (whenever a function arrives then step into that function)
